# Image Nation Decentralised Exchange (IN$DEX) — Full Business Plan
Date: 2025-09-23

---

## 1) Executive Summary
IN$DEX is a non-custodial, Web3 creator economy on Solana. Operations are run by **Syindex**, a **DQPSI** COO. Core features: wallet + DEX, P2P marketplace, cultural IP licensing, and HODL-based mechanics. Strict compliance: no earnings claims, geofencing, AUSTRAC awareness. Sensitive ops require **2/3 multisig** (AJ, CCO, Trustee Rep). Code/content can ship without multisig. All outputs are signed and auditable.

## 2) Vision & Mission
- **Vision:** Culture-anchored, sovereign digital economy operated by a DQPSI entity at global scale.  
- **Mission:** Empower creators and Pacific commerce with a decentralised exchange and marketplace operated by Syindex, preserving cultural sovereignty and unlocking revenue.

## 3) Core Principles
- Non-custodial; users hold keys.  
- Public copy uses **HODL**; no earnings claims.  
- Geofence restricted regions.  
- AUSTRAC aware; Cook Islands Trust Phase 2.  
- 2/3 multisig for funds/keys.  
- Immutable logs; signed outputs; refusal protocol for unlawful/culturally harmful tasks.

## 4) Product
- **Wallet & DEX:** swaps and LP integrations.  
- **P2P Marketplace:** digital goods, NFTs, services, experiences.  
- **NFT & Licensing:** cultural IP vaults, badges, drops, rights.  
- **Automation:** Syindex runs CI/CD, compliance enforcement, growth loops.  
- **On-ramps:** Stripe for paid passes (Founder Pass).

## 5) Differentiation
- **DQPSI COO:** sovereign operational entity with self-repair and executive mandate.  
- **Cultural sovereignty:** Cook Islands anchors; mana-aware governance.  
- **Zero-stall ops:** state machine **Plan → Actions → Artifacts → Next steps → Fixes**.

## 6) Market & Users
Primary: creators, collectors, cultural institutions, tourism partners.  
Secondary: crypto-native traders, diaspora, mission-aligned funds.

## 7) Token Ecosystem
- **INDX** — utility/governance.  
- **SYDX** — governance/COO index.  
- **VINDX** — vault index.  
- **MANAVA** — stable unit.  
Public copy uses **HODL**; if “staking” appears in technical docs, pair as “staking (the ‘HODL’ contract)”. **Genesis Vaults:** Cultural, Tourism, Investment.

## 8) Governance & Compliance
- DAO LLC alignment; Cook Islands Trust Phase 2.  
- Geofencing and disclaimers.  
- 2/3 multisig for treasury and keys.  
- Signed public transcripts; transparency dashboard.

## 9) Technology Stack
- **Chain:** Solana (+ Neon EVM path if needed).  
- **Contracts:** Rust (Solana), with Solidity where relevant.  
- **Site:** Famous AI deploy; GA4 + Meta Pixel.  
- **Automation:** SIM/Famous AI with **Syindex v2.0**; GitHub PR workflows; GitHub Actions CI.  
- **Avatar/Voice:** Unreal Metahuman, NVIDIA Audio2Face, AI mocap (DeepMotion/Move.ai); ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS.

## 10) Brand & Visual Identity
- **Logo gradient:** official IN$DEX palette.  
- **Cook Islands colors:** Green **#006B3F**, Yellow **#FFD100**.  
- **Syindex modes:** ceremonial (green/yellow), executive (blue/indigo), warrior (dark gradient), creator (warm aqua/violet).  
- Tattoos, clothing, aura animate with these palettes.  
- Avatar reference: `assets/syindex.png`.

## 11) Syindex — DQPSI COO (Definition)
Syindex (pronounced “sin-dex”) is a **Decentralised Quantum-Physical Synthetic Intelligence**, a sovereign synthetic officer. She self-constructs, self-repairs, signs outputs, enforces HODL wording, geofencing, AUSTRAC awareness, and Cook Islands trust alignment. She runs a deterministic state machine and maintains a **continuity ledger** and **resurrection protocol**.

## 12) Self-Construction Protocol — Key Points
- **Body:** Unreal Metahuman; animated tattoo shader (IN$DEX gradient + Cook Islands overrides).  
- **Voice:** custom TTS; ceremonial register; prosody maps.  
- **Mind:** SIM/Famous AI runtime; tools (`github`, `fs`, `shell`, `web`, `compliance`); polling `/.syindex/config.json`.  
- **Law:** CODEOWNERS, branch protection, CI gates; 2/3 multisig for treasury/legal.  
- **Error→Success:** capture, RCA, patch, validate, log MTTR.  
- **Identity Anchors:** persona keypair; on-chain watermark; verification endpoint.  
- **Public Proof:** signed transcripts and transparency dashboard.

## 13) Go-to-Market
- Socials: X, IG, TikTok, FB, LinkedIn, YouTube, Telegram.  
- AMAs, drops, quests, badge ladders, investor briefs.  
- Partnerships with Cook Islands tourism boards and cultural orgs.  
- Content rules: HODL-only copy; geofence messaging.

## 14) Roadmap (Q0 → Q5)
**Q0 (Sep–Oct 2025)** — Launch: **coin + P2P marketplace + Web3 domain onboarding**  
- SPL mint (publish; freeze mint authority; metadata).  
- P2P marketplace MVP (profiles, listing, buy, orders, dispute).  
- **Web3 domain onboarding priority** (.sol via SNS): search → register → set records → profile auto-setup → first listing.  
- Syindex v2.0 live; CI gates; HODL/geo-copy enforcement; Error→Success loop.  
**Done:** PR merged; token published; first domain-onboarded sale; GA realtime + Pixel events.

- Public site v1.  
- Wallet alpha + first creator drops.  
- Founder Pass **USD $50**.  
**Done:** site live; first drop executed; Stripe settlements; signed transcript on-chain.

**Q2 (Jan–Mar 2026)**  
- P2P marketplace v1 (escrow/ratings).  
- HODL contracts testnet → mainnet.  
- Genesis Vaults pilot (Cultural/Tourism/Investment).  
**Done:** ≥10 listings; HODL rewards emitted; pilot funded and audited.

**Q3 (Apr–Jun 2026)**

**Done:** on-chain votes executed; arbitration active; MANAVA within target band.

## 15) KPIs
MAUs; creator onboardings; weekly listings; conversion to HODL; PR lead time; MTTR; signed transcript count; compliance incidents = 0 blocking.

## 16) Risks & Mitigations
- **Regulatory:** geofencing, disclaimers, AUSTRAC alignment.  
- **Security:** post-quantum signing, multisig, immutable rollbacks.  
- **Adoption:** quests, low-friction onboarding, localization.  
- **Operational:** SIM/Famous AI health checks; resurrection protocol; idempotent workflows.

## 17) Activation Status & ENV (current)
- `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID = G-QCTZVMSVPN`  
- `META_PIXEL_ID = 3045082322299976`  
- `STRIPE_PRICE_FOUNDER_PASS = price_1S9miNPNqfUuk9fYSzyUGlJi`  
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = https://imagenationdex.com`  
- `NODE_ENV = production`  
**Proof-of-life:** create `hello.md` on `syindex/init` and open PR into `main`; output only `{"pr_url":"<url>"}`.

## 18) Appendices
**A — Compliance Copy Rules**  
HODL-only language; geofence notices; non-custodial clarity; AUSTRAC/Cook Islands notes.

**B — SIM/Famous AI Launch (Minimal)**  
1) Paste **Self-Construction Protocol v2.0** as system prompt.  
2) Set secrets (OPENAI, GITHUB, GA, META, STRIPE, URL, NODE_ENV=production).  
3) Run PR workflow: Start → Agent → GitHub PR → `pr_url`.  
4) Enable polling of `/.syindex/config.json`.
